This application is built with the help of TCP/IP Protocol.
These protocols are used with the help of low-level
networking in java ie with the help of sockets.
So if a client wants to communicate with other clients, 
it will first send the message to the server, the server will 
find the IP address of the other client and then forward 
the message.
